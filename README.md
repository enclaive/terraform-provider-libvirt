# Terraform provider for Libvirt confidential Virtual Machines

This is a terraform provider that lets you provision
servers on a [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) host via [Terraform](https://terraform.io/). 
Much emphasis is given to confidential VMs, following the [confidential computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing) paradigm.

## Introduction & Goals

Confidential virtualization is an emerging technology that enhances the security of virtual machines (VMs) by isolating their memory and execution from the host and other VMsâ€”even with privileged system software. This is achieved using hardware-backed techniques such as AMD SEV-SNP, ensuring that sensitive workloads remain protected from potentially compromised hypervisors or infrastructure administrators. Confidential VMs are critical for organizations that need to safeguard data-in-use and maintain strong security guarantees in cloud or on-premises environments.

The goal of this project is to maintain a Terraform provider that enables users to provision confidential virtual machines (VMs) on KVM-based infrastructure. By leveraging modern confidential computing features, this provider allows teams to automate and manage confidential workloads with Terraform, benefiting from software-defined infrastructure practices while maintaining robust security for sensitive data.

Currently, the provider supports provisioning confidential VMs using 
- [x] AMD SEV-SNP 
- [ ] Intel TDX

## Getting started

The provider is available for auto-installation from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dmacvicar/libvirt/latest).

In your `main.tf` file, specify the version you want to use:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    libvirt = {
      source = "enclaive/libvirt"
    }
  }
}

provider "libvirt" {
  # Configuration options
}
```

And now run terraform init:

```console
$ terraform init
```

### Creating your first virtual machine

Here is an example that will setup the following:

+ A virtual server resource

(create this as main.tf and run terraform commands from this directory):
```hcl
provider "libvirt" {
  uri = "qemu:///system"
}
```

You can also set the URI in the LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI environment variable.

Now, define a libvirt domain:

```hcl
resource "libvirt_domain" "terraform_test" {
  name = "terraform_test"
}
```

Now you can see the plan, apply it, and then destroy the infrastructure:

```console
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
$ terraform destroy
```

Look at more advanced examples [here](examples/) and check the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dmacvicar/libvirt/latest/docs).

## Manual installation

You can also manually download the provider from the [releases section](https://github.com/enclaive/terraform-provider-libvirt/releases) on Github. To install it, refer to the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html#provider-installation).

## Building from source

-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) is required for building.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enclaive/terraform-provider-libvirt.git
cd terraform-provider-libvirt
make
```

The binary will be called `terraform-provider-libvirt`.

### Using multiple hypervisors / provider instances

You can target different libvirt hosts instantiating the [provider multiple times](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#multiple-provider-instances). [Example](examples/v0.12/multiple).

### Using qemu-agent

From its documentation, [qemu-agent](https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Qemu_guest_agent):

>It is a daemon program running inside the domain which is supposed to help management applications with executing functions which need assistance of the guest OS.

Until terraform-provider-libvirt 0.4.2, qemu-agent was used by default to get network configuration. However, if qemu-agent is not running, this creates a delay until connecting to it times-out.

In current versions, we default to not to attempt connecting to it, and attempting to retrieve network interface information from the agent needs to be enabled explicitly with `qemu_agent = true`, further details [here](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt/blob/master/website/docs/r/domain.html.markdown). Note that you still need to make sure the agent is running in the OS, and that is unrelated to this option.

Note: when using bridge network configurations you need to enable the `qemu_agent = true`. otherwise you will not retrieve the ip addresses of domains. 

Be aware that this variables may be subject to change again in future versions.
